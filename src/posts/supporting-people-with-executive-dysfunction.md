## Question from J

> hi. i need help. my roommate is multiply disabled. recently they’re struggling with executive dysfunction- they’re too tired to eat, not showering often enough, not getting up to get food, not engaging in hobbies, etc. i’m wondering - what are ways that i can support them other than validating their feelings?
>
> i’m happy to support them by washing dishes, cleaning our room, microwaving their food, etc. though i can’t force them to eat or get up to get food. and there are moments where i feel like i need their input where they can’t contribute much (which is fine). so it feels a bit overwhelming for me to try to figure out adulting by myself, if that makes sense lol

## Answered by Courey

So for my combination of executive dysfunction and physical disability, my process goes like this:

1. Someone temporarily does some rescue tasks to get basic needs met (the bad times toolkits). Minimal guilt is the goal here.
2. Someone sitting with me and walking me through as I take over things like med management and bad time toolkit refills is the second goal.
3. Figuring out how to branch out of rescue mode and into making some meals myself and showering with real showers as tolerated. But making sure I still have bad times toolkits to fall back on if I need them.
4. Coming up with new strategies to maintain things long-term that works for me and I feel like I own and also planning ahead for more hard times in case they crop back up.
5. Having a set of resources I have gathered that I can use in times when one or all parts start breaking down. This is the pre-rescue rescue. Being able to stop the downward spiral before I hit total rock bottom.
6. Knowing that sometimes the cycle resets and I don’t manage to juggle things well and land on my face all the way at the bottom. Having a plan in place to help me get back up from that, and actually being able to self rescue.

Transitioning to the point where your roommate can take over setting up the “hard times toolkits” for themselves is a good first goal. If y’all find a system that works, focusing on, “These are the things I put in your lunchable that you really liked. Do you want to have a kitchen hang out on saturday while I do some of my own stuff and we can keep each other company while you also make a few lunchables just in case?” is a way that helps transition me to taking back over tasks.

I know a lot of these things are putting an extra burden on you, so finding ways to make it manageable is really important so you don’t burn yourself out. You need to also take care of yourself. Part of that is being able to vent appropriately and get support of your own. It’s normal to find helping someone out of The Pit™ frustrating sometimes. So remember to [“support in, dump out.”](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/laugh-cry-live/201809/how-respond-people-in-crisis-comfort-in-dump-out) That means, make sure you have an outlet for frustration that is healthy so it doesn’t get dumped back on your roommate or make them feel bad about themselves. Dump support into your roommate as you can, but dump frustration out too.

### Specifics

Foodwise, it helps a lot when someone makes me “adult lunchables.” This is just a few different packed lunch options (we use these sectioned tupperware containers that look like a plate) that have easy to eat food that I don’t have to really think about doing anything with. Just grab the “lunchable” and eat the finger food. It is the most basic of food-to-mouth options. If I’m really bad off, sometimes someone just stopping by my room and saying, “Hey, do you want me to grab you a lunch plate and a drink while I’m up?” helps because it makes me feel like they were already going that way anyway so I’m not overburdening them or anything.

Also having some shelf-stable easy to eat and access snacks by the bed helps. This is better paired with a trashcan directly beside the bed so that any trash can just be tossed without moving. This way the snack debris doesn’t build up and become yet another thing to feel terrible about. Just keeping an eye on the trashcan and emptying it if it doesn’t seem like something your roommate can do is a big help. Don’t make a fuss about it, just swipe the full bag out, plop a clean bag in, and move on without bringing attention to it if possible. Obviously if that feels like an invasion to them, don’t do it, but that can help.

Juice boxes, cans of soda water, and/or a big jug of water help with keeping hydrated.

For the showering part, I keep some baby wipes in a drawer by my bed. I have things like alcohol spray (to spray my pits), hand sanitizer (also works for a demi bath for stinky areas if it doesn’t hurt your skin), deodorant, and dry shampoo in the same box in the drawer.

So even if I can’t get out of bed I can take steps towards feeling cleaner. There are also dentasticks that you can use as a tooth cleaning option that doesn’t require a sink or anything. This kit really helps as a baby step between “no hygiene” and “hygiene I want to have but can’t always manage” so I don’t just feel like I’m failing at it completely. There are a lot of really helpful products for people that are bedridden, so check those out.

Also putting pills in containers for an entire week and right on the bedside can really help get things back on track if med management struggles are what is tripping them up. Just setting up a fun hang out time where you watch a movie or listen to music or something and put work on filling out a week or month’s worth of meds is a good way to make it approachable instead of overwhelming.
