disabled.life is an open content project with remixable templates for navigating life as a disabled person in an abled world. This is a brand new project and we are still figuring things out, so this website is still a bit of a mess, and there is a lot of generic template text, but not yet a lot of documentation. We're working on [crip time](https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5824/4684) and figuring out what we are doing as we go along.

disabled.life started as a conversation in the Disabled Techies Slack. We realized that there was a lot of community knowledge involved in "how to be disabled." We also recognized that access to that community knowledge was unevenly distributed. A public resource might be easier for some people to reach and use, especially compared to discussions that might be private and (ironically!) inaccessible if they happened across multiple types of disability.

Many of us were also long-time contributors to open content and free and open source software (FOSS) projects. We quickly realized this would be a good open content project. A series of reusable and remixable templates would save time and energy in the long run, because people wouldn't need to re-explain things from scratch every time a question was asked.

We couldn't find a project that did these things, so we started one. (Do you have a similar project? Let us know!)

We welcome contributors and contributions - though we still need a "how to contribute" guide! (Maybe you can help us with one?) For now, you can submit a pull request or [create an issue](https://github.com/disabledlife/disabledlife/issues) at [the project's github repo](https://github.com/disabledlife/disabledlife) or contact a project maintainer if you know them personally. We're aware this is a significant barrier to contribution, and hope to have a better way for people to contribute soon.
